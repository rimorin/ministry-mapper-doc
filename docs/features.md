## 📊 Unit/Household Tracking

### Comprehensive Visit Status Management

**Status Types:**

| Status | Description | Impact on Progress |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Not Done** | Initial state, not yet visited | Counted in incomplete |
| **Done** | Successfully completed | Counted as complete |
| **Not Home** | No one home, can retry | Counted after max tries |
| **Do Not Call (DNC)** | Household requests no visits | Excluded from counting |
| **Invalid** | Unit doesn't exist | Excluded from counting |

**Not Home Tracking:**
- Configurable maximum tries per congregation
- Automatic counter increment
- Treated as "done" after max attempts
- Prevents indefinite revisits

**Completion Logic:**
```
Complete when:
  - Status = Done, OR
  - Status = Not Home AND tries >= max_tries

Progress % = Completed / Total Countable Units × 100
```

**Household Options:**

## 🔗 Assignment System (Publisher Links)

### Secure, Time-Limited Access

**Link Features:**
- **Time-Limited:** Configurable expiry (default 24 hours)
- **Token-Based:** Secure 20-character access tokens
- **No Account Needed:** Publishers access via link only
- **Two Types:**
  - Normal assignments for regular territory work
  - Personal assignments for personal ministry

**Intelligent Assignment Algorithm:**

When requesting a new assignment, the system:

1. **Primary Factor:** Selects map with fewest active assignments
   - Prevents overloading single maps
   - Balances workload

2. **Secondary Factor:** Prefers geographically closer maps
   - Uses GPS coordinates
   - 50-meter threshold
   - Reduces travel time

3. **Tertiary Factor:** Prioritizes lower completion progress
   - Ensures balanced territory completion
   - Prevents some areas being neglected

**Assignment Workflow:**
```
1. Conductor generates assignment link
2. Link shared with publisher (QR, email, text)
3. Publisher accesses /map/:assignmentId
4. System validates token and expiry
5. Publisher updates address status in real-time
6. Link expires automatically
7. Admin receives real-time updates
```

**Assignment Management:**
- View active assignments per map
- See who has which territory
- Track assignment history
- Manual assignment deletion
- Automatic cleanup of expired links (every 5 minutes)
