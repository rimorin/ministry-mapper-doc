# Self-Hosting Ministry Mapper

!!! warning "Self-Hosting Not Recommended"
    Self-hosting Ministry Mapper requires significant technical expertise and ongoing maintenance. **We recommend using our hosted service at [ministry-mapper.com](https://ministry-mapper.com) instead.** Only proceed with self-hosting if you have:
    
    - Experienced system administrators or developers
    - Resources for ongoing maintenance and updates
    - Understanding of security best practices
    - Ability to comply with privacy regulations
    - Specific requirements that cannot be met by the hosted service

## Why We Don't Encourage Self-Hosting

While Ministry Mapper is open source, self-hosting comes with challenges:

- **Technical Complexity**: Requires knowledge of Docker, databases, web servers, and cloud infrastructure
- **Security Responsibility**: You're responsible for keeping everything secure and updated
- **Maintenance Burden**: Regular updates, backups, and monitoring are essential
- **Privacy Compliance**: You must ensure GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy law compliance
- **Cost**: Server costs, API costs, and time investment often exceed hosted service fees
- **Support**: Limited community support for self-hosting issues

## Prerequisites for Self-Hosting

If you've decided to self-host despite our recommendations, ensure you have:

### Technical Requirements
- Experience with Linux server administration
- Understanding of Docker and containerization
- Familiarity with environment variables and configuration
- Knowledge of web server configuration (Nginx/Apache)
- Experience with SSL/TLS certificates
- Understanding of DNS and domain configuration

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Cloud hosting service (Railway, Render, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)
- Domain name for your instance
- Email service for notifications (optional)
- Budget for API costs (Google Maps, Sentry, etc.)

### Time Commitment
- Initial setup: 2-4 hours
- Ongoing maintenance: 2-4 hours per month
- Emergency support when issues arise

## Architecture Overview

Ministry Mapper consists of two separate components:

1. **Backend (ministry-mapper-be)**: PocketBase server with Go extensions
   - Repository: [github.com/rimorin/ministry-mapper-be](https://github.com/rimorin/ministry-mapper-be)
   - Technology: Go, PocketBase, SQLite
   - Runs on port 8080 (Docker) or 8090 (local)

2. **Frontend (ministry-mapper-v2)**: React web application
   - Repository: [github.com/rimorin/ministry-mapper-v2](https://github.com/rimorin/ministry-mapper-v2)
   - Technology: React, TypeScript, Vite
   - Static files deployed to hosting service

Both must be deployed and configured to work together.

## Backend Self-Hosting Guide

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with these settings:

```bash
# Application Settings
PB_APP_NAME=Ministry Mapper
PB_APP_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com

# Initial Admin Account (change password after first login!)
PB_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@your-domain.com
PB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change_this_secure_password

# Email Configuration (SMTP)
PB_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
PB_SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
PB_SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
PB_SMTP_PORT=587
PB_SMTP_SENDER_ADDRESS=noreply@your-domain.com
PB_SMTP_SENDER_NAME=Ministry Mapper

# Security Settings
PB_ALLOW_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com
PB_HIDE_CONTROLS=true
PB_ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true

# Authentication (optional)
PB_OTP_ENABLED=false
PB_MFA_ENABLED=false

# Error Tracking (optional but recommended)
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
SENTRY_ENV=production
SOURCE_COMMIT=

# Service Integration (optional)
MAILERSEND_API_KEY=
MAILERSEND_FROM_EMAIL=
LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY=
LAUNCHDARKLY_CONTEXT_KEY=
```

### Docker Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rimorin/ministry-mapper-be.git
cd ministry-mapper-be
```

2. **Build Docker Image**
```bash
docker build -t ministry-mapper-backend .
```

3. **Run Container**
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/pb_data:/app/pb_data \
  --env-file .env \
  --name ministry-mapper \
  ministry-mapper-backend
```

**Important Notes:**
- Container runs on port 8080 internally
- Mount a persistent volume to `/app/pb_data` to preserve data
- Your database lives in the `pb_data` folder

4. **Access Admin Panel**
Navigate to `https://your-backend-domain.com/_/` and log in with your admin credentials.

### Local Development

For testing on your local machine:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/rimorin/ministry-mapper-be.git
cd ministry-mapper-be

# Install dependencies
./scripts/install.sh

# Configure environment
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Start application
./scripts/start.sh
```

Backend runs at `http://localhost:8090` by default.

### Database Backups

Your data is critical. Set up automated backups:

```bash
# Manual backup
tar -czf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /path/to/pb_data/

# Automated daily backup (add to crontab)
0 2 * * * tar -czf /backups/ministry-mapper-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).tar.gz /path/to/pb_data/
```
