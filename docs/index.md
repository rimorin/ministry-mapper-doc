# Welcome to Ministry Mapper

## What is Ministry Mapper?

Ministry Mapper is a modern web application that helps congregations manage their field ministry territories. Instead of using paper territory slips, Ministry Mapper lets you organize and track everything digitally from any device with an internet connection.

## Our Story

We started Ministry Mapper in 2022 as a simple project to help our local congregation. As more people found it useful, we kept improving it. Today, Ministry Mapper is used by congregations around the world, helping thousands of publishers stay organized in their ministry work.

## What Ministry Mapper Does

Ministry Mapper helps with three main areas:

- **For Territory Servants**: Makes it easy to manage all your territory records in one place. No more filing cabinets or lost papers.
- **For Field Service Conductors**: Quickly assign territories to publishers and see who has what territory at any time.
- **For Publishers**: Everyone can see updates in real-time and work together more effectively without overlapping or confusion.

## Problems Ministry Mapper Solves

### Going Paperless
Traditional paper territory slips get lost, damaged, or become hard to read over time. Ministry Mapper keeps everything digital and safe in the cloud. You can access your territories from your phone, tablet, or computer anytime.

### Better Organization
When territories are shared between multiple publishers, it's easy to accidentally work the same addresses. Ministry Mapper helps everyone see what's happening in real-time, so you don't waste time covering the same ground.

### Instant Updates
When someone updates a territory, everyone sees the changes right away. No waiting for papers to be passed around or meetings to share updates.

### Easier Record Keeping
Instead of manually writing down every change on paper slips, Ministry Mapper automatically tracks everything. This saves hours of work and prevents mistakes.

## How Ministry Mapper Works

### Modern Technology Made Simple
Ministry Mapper uses current web technologies to provide a smooth, reliable experience:

- **React Frontend**: A fast, responsive interface that works on any device (phone, tablet, or computer)
- **PocketBase Backend**: A powerful but easy-to-manage database system that stores all your information securely
- **Google Maps Integration**: See territories on an actual map to make planning easier
- **Multiple Languages**: Available in English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Indonesian, Malay, and Tamil

### Built for Reliability
- **Cloud-Based**: Your data is stored safely in the cloud and backed up automatically
- **Real-Time Sync**: Changes appear instantly for everyone using the system
- **Error Monitoring**: Problems are detected and fixed quickly to keep everything running smoothly
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Works perfectly on smartphones, tablets, and computers

## Important Considerations

### Privacy First
Ministry Mapper tracks residential addresses, which means you need to follow privacy laws in your area. Different countries have different rules (like GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California). Make sure you understand and follow your local regulations before using Ministry Mapper.

### Internet Required
Ministry Mapper works over the internet, so you'll need a connection to use it. If your area has unreliable internet, this might cause challenges. The app does work well on mobile data if WiFi isn't available.

### Google Maps Availability
Ministry Mapper uses Google Maps to show territories. In some countries, Google Maps may not work properly due to local restrictions. Check if Google Maps works in your area before setting up Ministry Mapper.

### Learning Curve
Moving from paper to digital is a change, especially for those less comfortable with technology. We provide help and support to make the transition easier for everyone in your congregation.
