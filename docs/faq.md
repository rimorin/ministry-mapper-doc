# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is Ministry Mapper?

Ministry Mapper is a modern web application that helps congregations manage field service territories digitally. Instead of using paper territory slips, Ministry Mapper lets you organize and track everything digitally from any device with an internet connection. It uses React for the frontend, PocketBase as the backend, and Google Maps API for territory visualization.

### How do I access Ministry Mapper?

**Recommended**: Use our hosted service at **[ministry-mapper.com](https://ministry-mapper.com)**

Simply:
1. Visit [ministry-mapper.com](https://ministry-mapper.com)
2. Create an account using the sign-up page
3. Verify your email address
4. Contact your congregation's administrator for proper permissions

**Alternative**: Self-hosting (not recommended) - see the [Self-Hosting Guide](self-hosting.md) for details. Self-hosting requires significant technical expertise and ongoing maintenance.

### Is Ministry Mapper free to use?

**Hosted Service**: Visit [ministry-mapper.com](https://ministry-mapper.com) for pricing and plans.

**Self-Hosting**: The source code is free and open-source, but you'll need to provide your own:
- Hosting for the frontend (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS)
- PocketBase backend deployment
- Google Maps API key (has a generous free tier)
- Optional: Sentry account for error monitoring

Note: Self-hosting costs (server, API fees, maintenance time) often exceed hosted service fees.

### What languages does Ministry Mapper support?

Currently supported languages:

- English
- Japanese (日本語)
- Korean (한국語)
- Chinese (中文)
- Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)
- Malay (Bahasa Melayu)
- Tamil (தமிழ்)

The interface automatically detects your browser's language. You can also manually switch languages in the app.

### Do I need technical knowledge to use Ministry Mapper?

**As a Publisher/User**: No technical knowledge needed! If you can use a smartphone or computer, you can use Ministry Mapper through the hosted service at [ministry-mapper.com](https://ministry-mapper.com).

**As a Self-Hosting Administrator**: Yes, significant technical knowledge is required:

- Experience with Linux server administration
- Understanding of Docker and containerization
- Knowledge of environment variables and configuration
- Familiarity with SSL/TLS certificates
- Web server configuration (Nginx/Apache)
- DNS and domain configuration

**We strongly recommend using the hosted service instead of self-hosting.** See the [Self-Hosting Guide](self-hosting.md) for complete details if you still want to self-host.

### Can Ministry Mapper work offline?

No, an internet connection is required for the app to function properly. This is because:

- It needs to connect to the PocketBase backend
- Google Maps API requires internet access
- Real-time updates between users require connectivity

The app does work well on mobile data if WiFi isn't available.

## Privacy and Legal

### What privacy laws should I consider?

**Important**: Ministry Mapper tracks residential addresses, which may be subject to data privacy laws. These laws vary significantly between countries and regions:

- **Europe**: GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **California**: CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- **Brazil**: LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados)
- **Many Others**: Various local regulations

**Please thoroughly review your local regulations and ensure compliance before using Ministry Mapper.** Consult a legal professional for proper legal advice specific to your area.

**Hosted Service**: The hosted service at [ministry-mapper.com](https://ministry-mapper.com) may provide compliance assistance, but you remain responsible for following your local laws.

**Self-Hosting**: You are fully responsible for all privacy law compliance.

### What data does Ministry Mapper store?

**User Data (managed by PocketBase):**

- Email address
- Name
- Password (encrypted)
- User roles and permissions

**Territory Data:**

- Territory boundaries and names
- Addresses
- Status information
- Notes about households
- Assignment history
- Update timestamps

**Technical Data (if Sentry is enabled):**

- Error logs
- Performance metrics

All data storage complies with security best practices. For hosted service data policies, check [ministry-mapper.com](https://ministry-mapper.com).

### Is Google Maps available in my region?

Ministry Mapper relies on Google Maps API, which may have limited functionality or be completely unavailable in certain countries or regions due to local restrictions. Please verify Google Maps availability in your area before implementing Ministry Mapper.

## Technical Setup (Self-Hosting)

3. **Deploy the `build/` folder** to your hosting provider:

   - Vercel: Connect your GitHub repo and configure environment variables
   - Netlify: Drag and drop the build folder or connect via Git
   - AWS S3: Upload build folder and configure static website hosting

4. **Ensure the PocketBase backend is deployed** and accessible at the URL specified in `VITE_POCKETBASE_URL`

See the [Frontend Setup Guide](frontend-setup.md) and [Self-Hosting Guide](self-hosting.md) for detailed instructions.

### How do I set up the PocketBase backend?

**For Self-Hosting Only** - Skip this if you're using the hosted service.

The backend is managed in a separate repository: [ministry-mapper-be](https://github.com/rimorin/ministry-mapper-be)

**Quick Overview:**

**Important**: The backend must be deployed and accessible before deploying the frontend.

### How do I get a Google Maps API key?

**For Self-Hosting Only** - Skip this if you're using the hosted service.

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Geocoding API
4. Go to Credentials and create an API key
5. Restrict the API key to your domain(s) for security
6. Note: Google Maps has a generous free tier (~$200 credit/month)

### How do I set up Sentry monitoring?

**For Self-Hosting Only** - Skip this if you're using the hosted service.

1. Create a [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) account

## Troubleshooting

### The app shows "Cannot connect to backend"

**For Hosted Service Users**: If you see this error, the service may be experiencing issues. Check the status page or contact support.

**For Self-Hosting Users**:

**Possible causes:**

1. PocketBase backend is not running or not accessible
2. `VITE_POCKETBASE_URL` environment variable is incorrect
3. CORS issues (backend not allowing frontend domain)

**Solutions:**

- Verify the backend is running and accessible
- Check the URL in your environment variables
- Configure CORS settings in PocketBase to allow your frontend domain

### Google Maps is not loading

**Possible causes:**

1. Invalid or missing Google Maps API key
2. API key restrictions blocking your domain
3. Required Google Maps APIs not enabled
4. Exceeded Google Maps free tier quota
5. Google Maps restricted in your country

**Solutions:**

- For hosted service: Contact support if you experience map issues
- For self-hosting: Verify your API key is correct and APIs are enabled
- Check API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
- Enable Maps JavaScript API and Geocoding API
- Check usage in Google Cloud Console
- Verify Google Maps availability in your region

### Changes are not reflected after rebuilding

**For Self-Hosting Only**:

**Possible causes:**

1. Browser cache
2. CDN cache (if using one)
