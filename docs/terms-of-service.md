# Terms Of Service

## Introduction

These terms of service ("Terms") apply to your access and use of Ministry Mapper (the "Service"). Please read them carefully.

## Accepting these Terms
If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all of the terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read all of the terms. If you don't agree to all of the terms below, please do not use the Service. Also, if a term does not make sense to you, please let us know by e-mailing rimorin@gmail.com.

## Changes to these Terms
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance, we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature or for some other reason.

Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective immediately after we post such revised Terms (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Terms) or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check Ministry Mapper for changes to these Terms.

If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, then you have accepted the changes to these Terms.

## Privacy Policy
For information about how we collect and use information about users of the Service, please check out our [privacy policy](privacy-policy.md).

## Third-Party Services
From time to time, we may provide you with links to third party websites or services that we do not own or control. Your use of the Service may also include the use of applications that are developed or owned by a third party. Your use of such third party applications, websites, and services is governed by that party's own terms of service or privacy policies. We encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any third party application, website or service that you visit or use.

## Creating Accounts
When you create an account or use another service to log in to the Service, you agree to maintain the security of your password and accept all risks of unauthorized access to any data or other information you provide to the Service.

If you discover or suspect any Service security breaches, please let us know as soon as possible.

## Your Content & Conduct

Our Service allows you and other users to create territories, record householder status and notes, and manage publisher links. You are responsible for the content that you make available to the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

When you create territories, record householder status and notes, or manage publisher links on the Service, you grant us the right and license to use, reproduce, modify, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute your content on or through the Service. We may format your content for display throughout the Service, but we will not edit or revise the substance of your content itself.

You have the ability to remove the content that you posted by deleting territories, householder statuses, notes, or publisher links. Once you delete your content, it will not appear on the Service, but copies of your deleted content may remain in our system or backups for some period of time. We will retain web server access logs and then delete them after a period of time.

While using our Service, we ask that you adhere to the following guidelines:

- Respect the privacy of householders. Do not share or include sensitive information about householders, such as addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, identity numbers, and credit card numbers.
- Use the system responsibly and with discretion. Do not post content that is libelous, defamatory, bigoted, fraudulent, deceptive, or illegal.
- Do not abuse the system. Avoid actions that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Service or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Service.
- Respect the privacy of other publishers. Do not collect any personal information about other users, or intimidate, threaten, stalk or otherwise harass other users of the Service.
- Do not attempt to circumvent the system settings. This includes any filtering, security measures, rate limits or other features designed to protect the Service, users of the Service, or third parties.

## Termination
If you breach any of these Terms, we have the right to suspend or disable your access to or use of the Service.
