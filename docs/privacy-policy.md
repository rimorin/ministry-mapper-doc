# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This privacy policy will help you understand what information we, as the creators of Ministry Mapper, collect, how Ministry Mapper uses it, and what choices you have.
We built the Ministry Mapper app as a free app. This SERVICE is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.
If you choose to use this Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our [Terms of Service](terms-of-service.md), which is accessible via this documentation, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

In order to use our Service, we may require you to provide us with your name and email address. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.  
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as an anonymous unique identifier. These are sent to your browser from the website that you visit and are stored on your deviceâ€™s internal memory.

This Service does use "cookies" to persist states across sessions. These cookies help to maintain a consistent user experience by remembering user's authentication state and preferences from session to session.

While you do not have the option to refuse these cookies within our Service, you can always manage cookies through your browser settings. Please note that if you choose to disable cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service as the state persistence might be affected.

## Location Information

Some of our services utilize location information transmitted from users' devices. We use this information specifically for territory locating purposes within the scope of the designated service.

## Device Information

We may collect certain information from your device. This information is used for troubleshooting, debugging, and performance monitoring purposes to improve our service and ensure a smooth user experience. Please note that this information does not include any personally identifiable information.

## Service Providers

We may employ third-party companies due to the following reasons:

- Authentication: To verify and manage user identities.
- Security: To protect our Service and users from threats and ensure a secure environment.
- Database Management: To store, organize, and manage user data.
- Cloud Infrastructures: To host our Service and manage data storage and retrieval.

We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your name and email address, which we collect. The reason is to perform tasks assigned to them on our behalf, specifically for authentication and security purposes. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

## Security

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
